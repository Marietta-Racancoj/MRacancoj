            <p>Welcome to my personal page!</p>

         
            <h2 align="center">Bio</h2>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: 20px;">I grew up in Pennsylvania surrounded by mountains and nature. I am passionate about technology and love learning new programming languages.
               I graduated with a bachelors in Music Education with a concentration in classical vocals and currently work as a choir director and principal organist for a church by the Jersey shore.
            I discovered my love of coding and software engineering later in life than many, but am nevertheless extremely passionate about learning as much as I can in the field and building my knowledge of various languages.

            <h2 align="center">Hobbies</h2>
            <p align="center" style="font-size: 20px;">In my free time, I enjoy walking at my local reservoir, coding, attending festivals, and exploring New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York State for unique food with my family and two close friends.
               I enjoy reading, cooking, collecting Funko Pops, occasionally working construction jobs with my dad, and learning about different cultures and histories around the world.
               I am half Indigenous and over the Summer when my job is less hectic, I enjoy attending cultural festivals especially Pow Wows in New Jersey and New York state to reconnect with my heritage.
               Though because of time constraints I have not been able to practice in a while, a personal hobby goal is to increase my pull strength in archery to a 50lb bow and eventually 75lb.
               I would also like to get better at traditional cooking, beadwork, and become fully fluent in Spanish and learn more of the K'iche Maya language to better connect with my heritage.
